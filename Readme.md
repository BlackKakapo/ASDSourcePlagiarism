# Source Plagiarism

This is one of the works for the university

I used:
1. Python


The application is designed to identify 
the sources from which the plagiarism 
was most likely made.

The algorithm:
1. Eliminate signs and numbers
2. Eliminate stopwords
3. Search for the most relevant words (10, 15, 20, 25, 30)
4. Using google API we search for these words
5. From the list we choose the 5 most relevant links
